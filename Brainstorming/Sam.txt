# Sam's brainstorming notes for week 2 project
General idea: use some sort of high-dimensionality MRI data to train SVM on some sort of disease functionality in a longitudinal study
- p_factor (maybe only in some studies?) as general psychopathology aka symptomology measure
- DMN in functional imaging?
- SVM specifically seemed to have good results with schizophrenia
	- Paper says that it can be difficult to interpret, but I wonder if we can treat this more as a classification question
- Resting state fMRI may also be useful?
- Emotional and cognitive action control networks were also good networks
